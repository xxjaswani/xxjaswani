He specializes in making Lofi beats with elements sourced from samples and live instruments. He made his debut in 2020 with single releases such as Let Go, State Of Mind, dreams, dusk, and christmas. He later refined his approach through a collection of EP and Album length releases such as travel.zip, social distancing, and his debut album echoes of silence. His output has been self-issued digitally and made available on all streaming platforms.
